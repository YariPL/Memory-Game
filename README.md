# Memory-Game
My project is the simple matching game, where the main goal is to match all 8 pairs of cards to win the game. The goal is to do it in the least possible number of moves.
Project is done by HTML + CSS and Javascript(mainly jquery + simple DOM manipulations). Shuffle function was taken from 'https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array'
